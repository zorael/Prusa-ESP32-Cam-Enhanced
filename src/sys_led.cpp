/* STATUS_LED_ENABLE is a board header setting that, until now, nothing read: the
   LED was initialised and toggled on every board regardless, so a board that set
   it false (the Freenove S3 Wroom did) still drove its pin. That is harmless
   until the pin is shared — on the Freenove WROVER v3 the onboard LED is GPIO 2,
   which is also SD D0, and a blink mid-transfer corrupts the card. So the flag is
   honoured here, in the one place that owns the pin, rather than at the five call
   sites that would each have to remember. */
